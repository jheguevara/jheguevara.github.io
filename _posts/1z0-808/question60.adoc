You are asked to develop a program for a shopping application, and you are given the following information: -> The application must contain the classes Toy, EduToy, and ConsToy.
The Toy class is the superclass of the other two classes.
-> The int caicuiatePrice (Toy t) method calculates the price of a toy.
-> The void printToy (Toy t) method prints the details of a toy.
Which definition of the Toy class adds a valid layer of abstraction to the class hierarchy?
