A resource created by tag is an AWS-generated cost allocation tag containing resource creator information that is automatically applied to the resources that you

create. This feature is only available in the Billing & Cost Management console, and will not appear anywhere else in the AWS console, including the Tag Editor.

Answer - D.
AWS provides two types of cost allocation tags: AWS-generated tags and user-defined tags.
AWS defines, creates, and applies the AWS-generated tags for you, and users define, create, and apply user-defined tags.
To use the AWS-generated tags, a management account owner must activate them in the Billing and Cost Management console.
When a management account owner activates the tag, the tag is also activated for all member accounts.
Option A is incorrect: Because AWS-generated tags should be activated.
Option B is incorrect: Because AWS-generated tags can only be activated in the management account.
Option C is incorrect: Same reason as Option.
B.
Also, it is not user-defined tags.
Option D is CORRECT: Because the tag can be activated in “Billing -&gt; Cost Management.

The correct answer for this question is D. Log in to the AWS console using the Management account and activate the AWS-generated tags in the Billing and Cost Management console.
Explanation: AWS provides several methods to manage cost allocation and tagging for resources. One of the ways to allocate costs for resources in AWS is through the use of AWS-generated cost allocation tags. Cost allocation tags can be used to organize resources based on their application, environment, owner, or any other attribute that makes sense for your organization.
In this scenario, the Management account's cost allocation report does not use the AWS generated cost allocation tags to organize the resource costs. To enable AWS-generated tags, you need to activate them in the Billing and Cost Management console using the Management account.
The Billing and Cost Management console is the central location for managing billing and cost allocation in AWS. To activate the AWS-generated tags, follow these steps:
1. Log in to the AWS console using the Management account.
2. Open the Billing and Cost Management console.
3. Choose Cost allocation tags from the left navigation menu.
4. Choose Activate AWS Cost Allocation Tags from the top right of the screen.
5. Select the checkbox to confirm that you understand the cost allocation implications.
6. Choose Activate.
This will activate the AWS-generated cost allocation tags for the Management account, and they will be applied to all the member accounts under consolidated billing.
Option A is incorrect because user-defined tags are not relevant to this scenario. User-defined tags are created by users and applied to resources to help organize and categorize them. They are not used for cost allocation.
Option B is incorrect because activating AWS-generated tags using the AWS CLI is not necessary for this scenario. Activating tags through the Billing and Cost Management console is the preferred method.
Option C is incorrect because user-defined tags are not relevant to this scenario. Activating user-defined tags in the Cost Explorer will not enable AWS-generated cost allocation tags.
